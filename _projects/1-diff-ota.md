This was the final project for ECE 511 at North Carolina State University.

ECE 511 Class Summary:
>Analog integrated circuits and analog integrated circuit design techniques. Review of basic device and technology issues. Comprehensive coverage of MOS and Bipolar operational amplifiers. Brief coverage of analog-to-digital conversion techniques and switched-capacitor filters. Strong emphasis on use of computer modeling and simulation as design tool. Students required to complete an independent design project.
