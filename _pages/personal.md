## Hobbies
### Reading
This year my goal is to read twelve books or an average of one book per month. I am thinking of alternating between fiction and non-fiction. For the non-fiction slots I plan on reading books related to the developement of the different fields in Physics or biographies of influential physisicts. For fiction, probably crime fiction or mystery more so than other categories.

- Book 1:

  - *Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About The Nature of Reality*
  - Manjit Kumar
  - This was a wonderful read. Having a background in Physics helped me to understand the magnitude of each developement. I think this would have been good to read prior to diving into Physics but I also don't think the story would have been as impactful if I had not already completed my undergrad in Physics.
  
- Book 2:

  - *And Then There Were None*
  - Agatha Christie
  - I have read a few other of Agatha Christie's novels: *Death on the Nile* and *Murder on the Orient Express*. I thoroughly enjoyed *And Then There Were None* along with the Agatha Christie novels I have read. I was stumped until I read the epilogue at the end. I had made a few guesses on who the culprit was but had to back track as each of my guesses met their end.

- Book 3:

  - *The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe*
  - Steven Weinberg
  - I was surprised at how connected particle Physics is to the beginning of the universe. I am finished but need to take time to discuss.

- Book 4:

  - *The ABC Murders*
  - Agatha Christie
  - Again I did not know who did it till the end! I am finished but need to take time to discuss.

- Book 5:

  - *Boltzmanns Atom: The Great Debate That Launched A Revolution In Physics*
  - David Lindley
  - Not finished. To be discussed.
