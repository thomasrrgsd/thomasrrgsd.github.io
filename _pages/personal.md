## Hobbies
### Reading
This year my goal is to read one book per month. I am thinking of alternating between fiction and non-fiction. For the non-fiction slots I am shooting for books related to Physics such as the developement of different fields in Physics or biographies of different influential physisicts. For fiction, probably crime more so than other categories.

- January

  - *Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About The Nature of Reality*
  - Manjit Kumar
  - This was a wonderful read. Having a background in Physics helped to understand the magnitude of each developement. I think this would have been good to read prior to diving into Physics but I also don't think I would have gotten as much out of it as I did had I not already completed my undergrad in Physics.
  
- February

  - *And Then There Were None*
  - Agatha Christie
  - I have read a few other of Agatha Christie's novels. I thoroughly enjoyed this one along with the others. I was stumped until reading the epilogue at the end. I had made a few guesses but had to back track as the characters died off.

- March (Tentative)

  - *The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe*
  - Steven Weinberg
