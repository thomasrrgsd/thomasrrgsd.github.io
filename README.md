Welcome to my portfolio! This website is meant to give the all details about myself that will not fit on a resume. For those who are interested to know.

This site is a modified version of the [GitBook Jekyll theme](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook) hosted on GitHub Pages.

What will you find on this website? You will find details about my work experiences, education, and any relevant projects. You can use the table of contents in the left sidebar to navigate the different sections. Each focused section will have many details and possibly images and videos related to the content. In the long format resume, you will find a summary of these focused areas as a webpage and as a downloadable PDF. Conversly, the short format resume section will have a condensed version of the long form resume meant to focus on the details I find the most relevant. The short form resume is meant to fit on one side of 11"x8.5" sheet of paper and so the entries must be very concise with my extensive work history.

If you would like to talk more with me, we can chat over email or through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/wtjarratt)! You can reach me at thomasjarratt@gmail.com.
