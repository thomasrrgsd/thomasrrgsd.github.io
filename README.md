Welcome to my portfolio! This website is meant to give the all details about myself that will not fit on a resume. For those who are interested to know.

This site is a modified version of the [GitBook Jekyll theme](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook).

What will you find on this website? You will find details about my work experiences, education, and any relevant projects. You can use the table of contents in the left sidebar to navigate the different sections.

If you would like to talk more with me, we can chat over email or through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/wtjarratt)! You can reach me at thomasjarratt@gmail.com.
